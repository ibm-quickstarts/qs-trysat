# try-sat (IBM Cloud edition)

Note: you can also find information about the [AWS edition](https://github.ibm.com/garage-satellite-guild/try-sat/tree/aws-article) and the [Azure edition](https://github.ibm.com/garage-satellite-guild/try-sat/tree/azure-article).

This set of scripts provides a mostly-automated way to set up a Satellite location and RedHat OpenShift cluster on IBM Cloud VPC Gen2 infrastructure, with a very simple sample app and built-in Satellite Link endpoint test.
This is not a model we would ever deploy for a real-world workload, but is useful for learning/experimenting/understanding.
Note that we haven't reviewed what try-sat creates in detail from a security perspective.

## What Does try-sat Create?

![What Does try-sat Create?](diagrams/whats-created.png)

*   A dedicated Resource Group.
*   A VPC (Gen 2) on IBM Cloud.
*   8 VSIs with RHEL v7: 3 Control Planes + 3 Worker Nodes + 1 Wireguard VPN server + 1 'on-prem' Satellite Link testing server, across three zones in the same VPC region.
*   A Satellite location, with the 3 control plane VSIs attached.
*   An 'on-prem' (network-adjacent to location) testing server which exposes a simple HTTP endpoint.
*   *Optional*:
    *   A ROKS cluster on the location, with the 3 VSIs assigned as worker nodes.
    *   A LogDNA instance attached to the cluster ([currently broken](https://github.ibm.com/garage-satellite-guild/try-sat/issues/80)).
    *   [A very simple sample app/container](https://hub.docker.com/r/nginxdemos/hello/) deployed to the cluster.
    *   A Satellite Link Location endpoint configured to connect to the 'on-prem' simple HTTP endpoint.

## How to Use

*   Clone this repository locally.
*   Copy `.envrc-template` to `.envrc` (at the root of this repo), then follow the instructions in `.envrc` to edit it and set `try-sat` configuration.
*   Run `source .envrc` before you continue (you will need to re-run this in each terminal you open whenever you run `try-sat` commands; you can use [direnv](PREREQS.md) to automate this).
*   Install the [pre-requisite tools](PREREQS.md). You may already have many of these.
*   Complete one of the methods listed below.

### Method 1: 'One-click' Private ROKS cluster on private endpoints, with WireGuard VPN

> Estimated time: 90mins

1.  Run `make all_private`, or `make all_private_location` to just create the location without the ROKS cluster (this can be added later by running `make all_private_cluster`).

2.  If you create the location, and you want to add LogDNA log forwarding from your cluster, you must first [activate the WireGuard VPN](#using-your-generated-cluster), then running `make configure_cluster_logdna`.

### Method 2: 'One-click' Public ROKS cluster on public endpoints, with WireGuard VPN in addition

> Estimated time: 90mins

Run `make all_public`, or `make all_public_location` to just create the location without the ROKS cluster (this can be added later by running `make all_public_cluster`).

### Method 3: Hands-on Step-by-step

**For now this method is deprecated, but if you wish you can likely figure this out from the `all_private` or `all_public` targets in the [Makefile](Makefile).**

## What Next? / Using Your Generated Cluster

*   If you are using Method 1 (private endpoints), open the WireGuard client and import the generated WireGuard configuration file from the root of the checkout directory (`wireguard-$(RESOURCE_PREFIX).conf`). Activate the VPN.

*   Run `make login_cluster`. You should then be able to run `oc` commands and work with your new cluster from the command line using `kubectl`/`oc`.  Or... open the OpenShift console through the IBM Cloud console.

*   If you want to deploy a sample app, run `make deploy_sample_app`. It should deploy the sample app and print out the route you can access it on. NOTE: If you access the OpenShift console first, you may find your browser refuses to use the plain HTTP route for this app because of HSTS. You should still be able to access it using e.g. `wget` or `curl`.

*   If you want to connect to the 'on-prem' (network adjacent to Satellite location) HTTP endpoint in order to test Satellite Link, run `make create_sat_link_endpoint`. It will make the endpoint and print out the endpoint you need to connect to. *This endpoint - because of the way Satellite Link works - will only be accessible from the IBM Cloud private network*. You can connect to it easily by activating the WireGuard VPN (even if you are using the Public method).

### Using Logging Consoles

There are a variety of different logging consoles available for a Satellite location and ROKS cluster. [The documentation covers this in detail](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-health), but in summary:

| Level at which logger operates | Service Name                  | Restrictions                                                                                                                                                             | Automatically configured by `try-sat`?                                                                                                                                                                    | What does it show?                                                           |

## Removing All Generated Resources

Run `make clean`. ‚ùó If you are going to re-run `try-sat` again, it's *strongly recommended* that you ensure that the `make clean` command has completed without error, and that you change your `RESOURCE_PREFIX` in `.envrc` before you create a new environment. This appears to be an issue with Satellite (see [here](https://github.ibm.com/alchemy-containers/satellite-planning/issues/1337) for issue and [here](https://ibm-garage.slack.com/archives/C01149RMSCU/p1614795537486000) for Slack discussion thread).

## Troubleshooting

*   If you are trying to debug `try-sat`, you may want to run `make watch` (in a spare terminal window). This will help you watch the status of various key resources as they are created and will give a greater understanding of what's going on. Note that many errors will show in the early stages of creation - this is to be expected as resources won't exist yet.

*   If you want to log into one of your control plane nodes/worker nodes, `try-sat` creates a backdoor using SSH. After you've run `try-sat`, you can run `make ssh_bastion`, which should print out a password, print out the IPs of the various hosts created, and then automatically login you to the bastion host (aka, the Wireguard server). From there, you can connect to any of the internal IPs using `ssh user@<ipaddress>`, entering the same password which has been printed out.

*   If you want to record all the terminal output of `try-sat`, you might find [script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_\(Unix\)) helpful.
