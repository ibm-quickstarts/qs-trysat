# try-sat (IBM Cloud edition)

Note: you can also find information about the [AWS edition](https://github.ibm.com/garage-satellite-guild/try-sat/tree/aws-article) and the [Azure edition](https://github.ibm.com/garage-satellite-guild/try-sat/tree/azure-article).

This set of scripts provides a mostly-automated way to set up a Satellite location and RedHat OpenShift cluster on IBM Cloud VPC Gen2 infrastructure, with a very simple sample app and built-in Satellite Link endpoint test.
This is not a model we would ever deploy for a real-world workload, but is useful for learning/experimenting/understanding.
Note that we haven't reviewed what try-sat creates in detail from a security perspective.
*You are responsible for the artifacts you create*.
See the [disclaimers](DISCLAIMERS.md) for more.

## What Does try-sat Create?

![What Does try-sat Create?](diagrams/whats-created.png)

*   A dedicated Resource Group.
*   A VPC (Gen 2) on IBM Cloud.
*   8 VSIs with RHEL v7: 3 Control Planes + 3 Worker Nodes + 1 Wireguard VPN server + 1 'on-prem' Satellite Link testing server, across three zones in the same VPC region.
*   A Satellite location, with the 3 control plane VSIs attached.
*   An 'on-prem' (network-adjacent to location) testing server which exposes a simple HTTP endpoint.
*   *Optional*:
    *   A ROKS cluster on the location, with the 3 VSIs assigned as worker nodes.
    *   A LogDNA instance attached to the cluster ([currently broken](https://github.ibm.com/garage-satellite-guild/try-sat/issues/80)).
    *   [A very simple sample app/container](https://hub.docker.com/r/nginxdemos/hello/) deployed to the cluster.
    *   A Satellite Link Location endpoint configured to connect to the 'on-prem' simple HTTP endpoint.

## How to Use

*   Clone this repository locally.
*   Copy `.envrc-template` to `.envrc` (at the root of this repo), then follow the instructions in `.envrc` to edit it and set `try-sat` configuration in particular, RESOURCE_PREFIX (ie try-sat-test-# which will prefix all resources that are created) and IC_API_KEY (with an ibm cloud api key).
*   Use [this link](https://cloud.ibm.com/schematics/workspaces/create?terraform_version=terraform_v1.0&repository=https://github.com/ibm-quickstarts/qs-trysat/tree/master/terraform) to create a workspace in IBM Schematics. Add the same values for IC_API_KEY (make sure you select the sensitive box to keep your credentials from being exposed in the logs) and RESOURCE_PREFIX that you used in the step above under the settings tab (and any other values that you changed in the `.envrc`).
*   Apply the schematics plan in the UI.
*   Once the job has completed we can run the followup tasks from the terminal
*   From the repo directory, run `source .envrc` (you will need to re-run this in each terminal you open whenever you run `try-sat` commands; you can use [direnv](PREREQS.md) to automate this).
*   Install the [pre-requisite tools](PREREQS.md). You may already have many of these.
*   Complete one of the methods listed below.
*   Run `make all_public_cluster` to create the satellite cluster and configure the hosts.

## What Next? / Using Your Generated Cluster

*   Run `make login_cluster`. You should then be able to run `oc` commands and work with your new cluster from the command line using `kubectl`/`oc`.  Or... open the OpenShift console through the IBM Cloud console.

*   If you want to deploy a sample app, run `make deploy_sample_app`. It should deploy the sample app and print out the route you can access it on. NOTE: If you access the OpenShift console first, you may find your browser refuses to use the plain HTTP route for this app because of HSTS. You should still be able to access it using e.g. `wget` or `curl`.

*   If you want to connect to the 'on-prem' (network adjacent to Satellite location) HTTP endpoint in order to test Satellite Link, run `make create_sat_link_endpoint`. It will make the endpoint and print out the endpoint you need to connect to. *This endpoint - because of the way Satellite Link works - will only be accessible from the IBM Cloud private network*. You can connect to it easily by activating the WireGuard VPN (even if you are using the Public method).

### Using Logging Consoles

There are a variety of different logging consoles available for a Satellite location and ROKS cluster. [The documentation covers this in detail](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-health), but in summary:

| Level at which logger operates | Service Name                  | Restrictions                                                                                                                                                             | Automatically configured by `try-sat`?                                                                                                                                                                    | What does it show?                                                           |

## Removing All Generated Resources

Run `make clean`. ‚ùó If you are going to re-run `try-sat` again, it's *strongly recommended* that you ensure that the `make clean` command has completed without error, and that you change your `RESOURCE_PREFIX` in `.envrc` before you create a new environment. This appears to be an issue with Satellite (see [here](https://github.ibm.com/alchemy-containers/satellite-planning/issues/1337) for issue and [here](https://ibm-garage.slack.com/archives/C01149RMSCU/p1614795537486000) for Slack discussion thread).

## Troubleshooting

*   If you are trying to debug `try-sat`, you may want to run `make watch` (in a spare terminal window). This will help you watch the status of various key resources as they are created and will give a greater understanding of what's going on. Note that many errors will show in the early stages of creation - this is to be expected as resources won't exist yet.

*   If you want to log into one of your control plane nodes/worker nodes, `try-sat` creates a backdoor using SSH. After you've run `try-sat`, you can run `make ssh_bastion`, which should print out a password, print out the IPs of the various hosts created, and then automatically login you to the bastion host (aka, the Wireguard server). From there, you can connect to any of the internal IPs using `ssh user@<ipaddress>`, entering the same password which has been printed out.

*   If you want to record all the terminal output of `try-sat`, you might find [script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_\(Unix\)) helpful.
